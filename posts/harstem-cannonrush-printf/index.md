# Harstem's video guide, from October 2019

An hour of Harstem playing cannon rush defense against Printf himself. Very informative.

## Some (incomplete) notes

* Use a forge, get your own cannons to zone out the enemy's probe and prevent further cannons from going up.
* Behind the cannons, the enemy will often go for a proxy stargate + void rays; get your own stargate to counter that.
    * This means the game often turns into a race for gas.
* It's often fine to fully wall off. You want to prevent workers getting into your main and getting vision.
* *"For diamond/low masters and below, the opponent will not have good probe micro; you can often just kill their probe."*
* the 3 pylon wall is easy to do from the cannon rusher's side; you can often just pull workers and kill it
